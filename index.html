                            <p>Why should you even think about the cannabis market as an investment or future option? Well… This is a 
                                market which has been showing an average yearly growth of over 65%! The total market cap (Value) of 
                                cannabis companies traded on the capital markets currently stands at over $48 Billion and is forecasted 
                                to grow to over $70 Billion by 2027.

                                Here we are, in 2020, dealing with a global pandemic and yet this industry is on a relentless rise, 
                                with stocks like “Green Thumb Industries” and "Cresco Labs" exhibiting a yearly growth of 168% and 
                                215% respectively. These are incredible numbers to observe, in a highly regulated industry. So now is 
                                the right time to establish your Cannabis Stock watchlist and keep track of the industry's high 
                                performers.

                                Classic stock investments such as bank stocks or stocks of big corporation like Microsoft, Apple 
                                and others, are still reliable and solid; however,their annual growth and potential return on 
                                investment is close to 3-5%. Cannabis Stocks on the other hand, exhibit an annual average return 
                                of 65%; the comparative gains are therefore much higher.</br>

                                The Cannabis market is the NEW “GOLD RUSH”. An investment today can potentially grow by 2-3 times in coming 
                                years.</br>
